# Operating-System-Projects

This repository contains two projects:

1. **Shell Terminal for Ubuntu**:  
   A minimalist Ubuntu shell terminal that allows users to implement custom commands and define personalized keywords to execute specific actions, effectively simulating basic terminal functionalities.

2. **Single Lane Bridge Problem**:  
   An implementation addressing the classic synchronization challenge where a one-lane bridge permits traffic from only one direction at a time. The project includes a PDF explaining the problem and a ZIP file with code demonstrating a solution using synchronization techniques to prevent collisions and ensure safe passage for vehicles.
